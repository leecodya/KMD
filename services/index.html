							<p>To keep your water heater running properly and efficiently and to extend its 
							life, maintenance procedures need to be performed. As water is pumped into 
							your water heater tank dirt, sediment and various minerals settle on the 
							bottom. Depending on your water quality these extra "ingredients" can add 
							up rather quickly robbing your water heater's efficiency and costing you 
							in the long run. If left unchecked they can not only make your water 
							heater work harder but also allow your tank to rust and slowly be eaten 
							away until you need to replace the entire unit which is very costly yet 
							easily preventable. Call Keith McDonald Plumbing today for service for 
							your water heater.</p>
